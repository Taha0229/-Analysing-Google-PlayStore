This is a Exploratory Data Analysis project which I conducted over Google PlayStore to find application trends.


**Analysis of Google Play Store depending upon applicationâ€™s category and type -**

In this data science project I tried to analyse the following questions that an android application company would like find about :
1. How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
  ![top_genres](https://github.com/Taha0229/Analysing-Google-PlayStore/assets/113607983/be8339fe-c3a3-421c-828d-ede0d72c552b)

2. Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity

3. How many downloads someone would give up by making their app paid vs. free

4. How much someone can reasonably charge for a paid app

5. Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
6. How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue

**Outcomes of the analysis**
<br>
1. Impact of Paid vs. Free Apps: Analyzed the relationship between pricing models and app downloads. Quantified the difference in downloads.
2. Reasonable Pricing for Paid Apps: Analyzed the pricing distribution for paid apps in different categories. Consideration of app features, quality, and competition to determine reasonable pricing.
3. Development Cost Recovery Analysis: Assessed sales revenue of paid apps to determine cost recovery. Provided insights on the percentage of paid apps likely to recover development costs.

**The data was visualised using multiple charts like : pie chart (donut pie chart), bar charts, horizontal bar charts, scatter plots which represents three dimensional values, grouped bar charts and box plots
Languages and Tools : Python : Pandas, Plotly, Google Colab**
